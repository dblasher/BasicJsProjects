# BasicJsProjects

Collection of projects demonstrating what I've learned in Javascript


[Project hosted here]( https://dblasher.github.io/BasicJsProjects/)

1. <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zStaticShockz/BasicJsProjects/blob/master/TodoList/todolist.html">ToDoList</a>:
Emphasis for this project was learning to map out the versions of a program and improve it piece by piece. This was also my first real practice of using objects to organize program functionality by having view, handler, and todoList objects with their respective methods. Perhaps this is a watered down example of the model, view, controller architecture?

The next steps I'd like to take on improving this project are items on the todo list itself.

2. <a href="https://codepen.io/zStaticShockz/full/bqmKMg/">Etch a Sketch</a>:
First project suggested by The Odin Project. Great way for me to apply jQuery and DOM manipulation. I had the random color button working for a little while but eventually got ahead of myself and broke it. My goal is to be able to color some nodes one color, then press random color to change to a new color and only apply that to nodes that haven't received a color yet. So say you drew the brown trunk of tree, hit random color and got a shade of green, then colored the tree canopy, hit random again and used a shade of blue to make the sky/background. After I accomplish that functionality and refactor the code I'll consider this project complete.

3. Untitled RPG

Still have this offline but my goal is to first have a text based Hero object versus a random monster object. Once I have that working I'll add some graphics like hearts for hitpoints and other icons to represent inventory items. Third will be adding a time function where different events can occur and time passes every time you call a Hero's method. Finally would be a grid to navigate, different nodes on that grid will have a random collection of loot, monsters, or events. One of those nodes will contain a boss, you're job will be to find the boss and any items you need to defeat it! This project was inspired by the PathFinder adventure card game.

4. Track and Field Simulator

Details to come.
